  Discogs Helper allows users to search for and manage there collection of vinyl records. By leveraging the Discogs API I was able to sync up a users collection and wantlist
  according to there account with Discogs. Users can add, update, delete, and view records in their collection, which includes details such as title, artist,
  release year, genre, and style. The application will provide an interface for users to keep track of their vinyl collection and make necessary updates over time. 
  Additionally, users can manage a wish list of vinyl records, adding items they wish to acquire. This tool will help vinyl enthusiasts efficiently organize and maintain
  their collection, allowing them to track records of interest and manage their collection with ease.
